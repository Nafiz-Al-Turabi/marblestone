                        <p className="text-gray-600">Pricing the home correctly is one of the most important factors in getting it rented quickly. Overpricing the home will cause the property to rent less quickly, costing you time and money.

                            We start with a competitive rental price analysis which combines market data with our professional knowledge of current market conditions to give you the most accurate rental price possible. This will get the home rented fast and for the most that the
                            market will bear.</p>

We take professional photos and video tours of our homes - In our experience properties that have professional photos get rented much faster.</p>
