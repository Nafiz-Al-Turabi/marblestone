                    <p>Collecting rent is easy if you have the perfect tenant who pays on time! But what if they donâ€™t? Having someone in your corner who knows tenant law and the proper notices to send is critical!</p>

                    <p>If a tenant has gone beyond the grace period of the lease we provide them with a late rent notice, where we collect the appropriate late fees along with the normal rent amount. Worse case, if we have a tenant that does stop paying rent, we will assist in the eviction process and re-renting the property quickly.

                        We make paying rent easy for tenants with the online tenant portal that can be accessed 24/7. We encourage tenants to pay online, which means we can pay you out faster.</p>
